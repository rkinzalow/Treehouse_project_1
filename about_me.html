        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <img src="images/britt_ryan.JPG" alt="Britt and I together" class="image-right">
        <p>Iâ€™m an full time truck driver looking to get back to my roots in web development. Life has taken me many places but I am looking to refresh and build on my knowledge of web design I started over 10 years ago.  </p>
        
        <p>I first work as a web admin for a small family business in my early 20s but Life took me in a different direcetion. I moved out of state for a while before I found my way back working for Amazon in the transportation department. After working in the transportation department for a while it lead to get my CDL and started over the road driving.</p>
        
        <p>My wife and I met while working at Amazon and now we both have our CDL. We drove all over the United Sates as a team for about a year until we settled in our home in cleveland, TN. We both drive local currently but are working to change careers into web development. </p>
        <p> So the next chapter begins, cheers and happy coding everyone!</p>
